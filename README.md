# Chance To Beat

A LiveSplit component to estimate the probability of beating a specified time.

## Install

Download the lastest version from the [Releases page](../../releases) and put
LiveSplit.ChanceToBeat.dll in LiveSplit's components folder.

## Setup

Add the component to the Layout (Information -> Chance To Beat). From here you
can change the text displayed (so like "PB Chance" or "Sub 1 Chance") and the
target time.

You can also set the probability for the run ending on any given split. This is
particularly good if the run can die at a certain point due to RNG, or it's easy
to take a death, and that isn't reflected in the splits.
